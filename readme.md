## Development

This site is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and requires at least version 2.0.0 for asset compilation.

To run this site locally, open Terminal and install Jekyll:

    gem install jekyll

Then in this folder, run

    jekyll serve --watch

You can then access the site at http://localhost:4000/ and the CoffeeScript file will be updated every time you save.
